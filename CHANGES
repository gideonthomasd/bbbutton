#### 08/03/2005 ####
- the application commands are now by default appended a "&" 
  at the end, if you include a "&" at the end an error will be
  raised and the application will not run!

- Major code cleanups. The application now runs in one thread.

#### 06/03/2005 ####
- New configuration parser
  
- Maximum limit of buttons to load is no more hardcoded. It
  can be tweaked to your liking through ~/.bbbuttonrc 
  
- Comments on the configuration file and null lines are
  disregarded instead of crashing the application

#### 15/01/2003 ####

- Tide up rest of the code.

#### 10/01/2003 ####

  something more user friendly.
   
#### 29/11/2002 ####
- Fixed mouse click problem. Only left mouse button should be
  used to press a button.

#### 09/11/2002 ####
- Modified the Makefile so that the code compiles under FreeBSD.
- Corrected minor typos in the CHANGES file.

#### 29/10/2002 ####
- Changed icon fonts so they adopt the wm's background
  color. Anyway the click efect is much better now (I think).

#### 23/09/2002 ####
- Changed most of the code to object oriented.
- Implemented a configuration file (.bbbuttonrc), so we 
  don't have to deal with xinitrc.

#### 26/07/2002 ####

  purposes.
