1. What is bbbutton

    This is a dock application for BlackBox (not only), that allows you
    to create single application launch buttons with the image and
    application launch of your preference.
    
2. Install/Uninstall/Upgrade

    tar -zxvf bbbutton_0.8.tar.gz
    cd bbbutton_0.8
    make <systype>        (systypes recognised: linux, freebsd)
    make install ( or uninstall )
    
    NOTE: To upgrade to version 0.8 replace your existing "bbbutton"
          binary, but remember to use the new .bbbuttonrc format
          as outlined in the next section.

3. OK, now what !!
  
   Load multiple buttons when your X windows start using the 
   configuration file .bbbuttonrc which is located 
   in your home directory (try ls -a !!!). There we go in simple
   steps:
	
   a) Edit .bbbuttonrc file and type in the bbbuttons you wish 
      to create.
      
      i.e your .bbbuttonrc should contain something like this:
      #--File .bbbuttonrc start---------------------
	#------------------------------------------------#
	#        BBButton Configuration file             #
	# Format: <path to XPM image> <program to run>   #
	#------------------------------------------------#

	[BUTTON_NO]
	MaxButtons   =   20

	[LOAD]
	/root/.DesktopIcons/opera.xpm opera
	/usr/local/shared/icons/cd1.xpm /usr/local/bin/exampleBin
	#/root/.DesktopIcons/bcb.xpm bash --login startbcb   
	/root/.DesktopIcons/gambas.xpm gambas
	/root/.DesktopIcons/xmms.xpm xmms
	/root/.DesktopIcons/mail.xpm sylpheed

      #--File .bbbuttonrc end------------------------

   b) You need to load bbbutton itself through xinitrc.
      
      i.e your xinitrc should contain this:
      --File xinitrc start-
       bbbutton &
       exec blackbox
      --File xinitrc end--- 
      
4. Requirements

    - The image must be of type 'xpm' and size '48x48'
      ( XV, ImageMagic and Gimp are some applications 
        that could do that for you)
